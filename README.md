## <a name="about-the-app">About the app</a>

Simmerize brings together all the recipes I love to cook, in one place. Each recipe is described in detail: time, ingredients, instructions and nutritional values.

This blog is available in French and English.

This project is not under active development, but new features may be added from time to time.

**New recipes are added regularly**!
